Hi 👋 My name is Aaron Rodi
Software Developer
Passionate Software Developer. I’ll be graduating in December with my AAS in Web Development. When I’m not doing my school work, I am building projects and refining my skills. This is my passion. I am 31 years old and spent the majority of my life wondering if I’d ever have a legitimate career in something I’m passionate about and I have finally found it. I would highly appreciate any advice from people currently in or pursuing a career in development. One day I want to be the one giving up-and-coming developers advice on how to succeed in this industry.

🌍  I'm based in Lafayette, Louisiana
